Blog
====
This repository contains a blog skeleton for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
a static website generator. This is meant as a recreational activity
and has not any particular goal.

Install
-------
Install Hugo on your machine, run `hugo` in the website directory
and the site must be generated in a `public`folder. For now,
the website will be hosted on GitHub pages.

TODO
----
There is a lot to do. But the next steps are:

* find nice colors
* add fun pictures
* write articles
* correct menu-nav display on small screen
